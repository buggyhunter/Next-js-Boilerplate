# A Developer's Reverie

Between the brackets and the braces,
We build our quiet, hidden places—
A world of logic, line by line,
Where tangled thoughts become design.

The cursor blinks, a steady beat,
A heart that hums through code's heartbeat.
We chase the bugs through endless night,
And greet the dawn with tests that write.

Each commit, a stepping stone,
Each merge, a bridge from the unknown.
We push, we pull, we start anew—
The build is green. The dream breaks through.

So here's to those who sit and type,
Who squint at diffs by monitor light,
Who find in semicolons, grace,
And make the world a better place.
