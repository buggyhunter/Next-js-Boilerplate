# Programming Poetry

## The Coder's Journey

In the realm of zeros and ones we dwell,  
Where logic reigns and algorithms tell  
Stories of functions that never sleep,  
And variables that secrets keep.

We speak in languages strange and new,  
Python's grace and C++'s virtue,  
JavaScript dancing on the screen,  
While SQL queries stay serene.

Debug the bugs that hide in shadows,  
Chase the errors through code meadows,  
Stack overflow, our faithful friend,  
Helps us find where problems end.

Compile, test, and then deploy,  
Each successful build brings joy,  
But when the code breaks in the night,  
We code until the morning light.

For we are builders of digital dreams,  
Crafting apps and complex schemes,  
In this world of endless learning,  
Where curiosity keeps burning.

So here's to all who write and code,  
Who walk the programmer's noble road,  
May your functions always return true,  
And may your coffee see you through.
